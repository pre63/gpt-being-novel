## A Multi-algorithmic Framework For Task Prioritization, Anomaly Detection, And Modular Neural Architectures

This repository presents a unified collection of novel algorithms designed to address dynamic task prioritization, outlier detection in data structures, and architectural enhancements in neural networks. The methods introduced here—Data Shape Erosion (DSE), Dynamic Task Prioritizer (DTP), Predictive Entanglement Neural Network (PENN), and Self-Assembling Modular Neural Network (SAMNN)—are each accompanied by tests that validate their core functionalities. The purpose of this paper is to describe the theoretical motivations, implementation details, and experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms.

### Abstract

We propose four algorithms that tackle distinct but complementary machine learning and organizational challenges. Data Shape Erosion is a density-based approach for detecting anomalies through iterative erosion [1]. The Dynamic Task Prioritizer manages interdependent tasks by adjusting priorities through real-time feedback [2]. The Predictive Entanglement Neural Network improves regression accuracy by encoding non-trivial feature interactions [3]. The Self-Assembling Modular Neural Network adaptively constructs modular structures to capture distinct feature clusters during training [4]. Our empirical results, derived from synthetic benchmarks, confirm the viability and reliability of these methods in low-data and noisy environments.

### Introduction

Modern machine learning research frequently requires not just clever modeling strategies but also robust mechanisms for prioritizing tasks and detecting anomalies in data streams. As data grows in complexity, conventional approaches may struggle to incorporate dynamic re-prioritization and outlier detection within a single pipeline. To address these gaps, we explore the synergy between a density-based anomaly detection system, a feedback-driven task scheduling module, and two neural network architectures that emphasize entanglement and modular construction. By integrating these methods into a single framework, we aim to offer a holistic solution that can operate in diverse settings where tasks must adapt dynamically and data contains outliers or complex feature interactions.

### Data Shape Erosion (DSE)

Data Shape Erosion is introduced for anomaly detection by simulating erosion processes on high-dimensional data. Inspired by density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN [1], the algorithm systematically erodes data in multiple steps. Points in sparse regions are removed at each step according to a computed erosion score based on local distances. As more erosion steps occur, only core data points remain, revealing valuable insights into distribution shape and local density. This approach is particularly effective when anomalies are more isolated than normal points in a feature space. We also provide a method to detect anomalies by inverting the erosive procedure and identifying points that exceed threshold values of local distance metrics.

### Dynamic Task Prioritizer (DTP)

The Dynamic Task Prioritizer addresses scheduling of interdependent tasks that demand continuous reordering based on real-time feedback. Constructed on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) [5], each node represents a task with edges indicating dependencies. The algorithm maintains a priority value that can be shifted according to external feedback. Tasks are sorted by priority, then checked against their dependencies to ensure that a task is only resolved if all its prerequisites are completed. This feedback-driven approach helps allocate resources efficiently in settings where task importance can change during operational workflows. Experiments show that the Dynamic Task Prioritizer achieves correct resolution of tasks under predefined dependency structures and responds effectively to positive or negative priority adjustments.

### Predictive Entanglement Neural Network (PENN)

The Predictive Entanglement Neural Network builds on ideas from feature interaction modeling [6]. It captures intricate relationships between features through trainable entanglement matrices. Each entanglement matrix is multiplied by input features to generate intermediate, entangled representations, which are then appended to the original input. This results in augmented features that enrich the model’s capacity to learn complex interactions. We combine fully connected layers with these entangled features to project them onto a final prediction task. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that PENN lowers error rates on synthetic data, particularly in scenarios where nonlinear and correlated features challenge standard neural network architectures.

### Self-assembling Modular Neural Network (SAMNN)

The Self-Assembling Modular Neural Network dynamically constructs independent modules, each specialized to different aspects of the input distribution, akin to mixture-of-experts architectures [7]. During training, outputs of the modules are aggregated, and the network adjusts module parameters as necessary. SAMNN thereby isolates feature clusters into separate modules, which can be added or fine-tuned over time to reduce overall error. Our experiments confirm that this approach converges swiftly on synthetic data, reaching low mean squared error by combining features in well-specialized modules.

### Experimental Results

Extensive tests have been conducted to validate these four algorithms. Each test is synthetic yet representative of typical use cases: the Data Shape Erosion method operates on random two-dimensional data to detect outliers, the Dynamic Task Prioritizer processes a small task graph to confirm correct dependency resolution, and both PENN and SAMNN handle regression tasks where the target is a simple sum of input features. Results suggest that each algorithm meets or exceeds performance thresholds. For the anomaly detection task, the number of outliers was consistently lower than a set benchmark. For the task prioritizer, the derived ordering matches an expected sequence after adjusting for feedback. Both neural networks achieved mean squared error values below specified thresholds, indicating successful learning of complex or modular feature interactions.

### Conclusion And Future Work

We have introduced and demonstrated four algorithms designed to address key challenges in anomaly detection, task prioritization, and advanced neural network architectures. Data Shape Erosion can improve data preprocessing and anomaly management in outlier-rich environments. The Dynamic Task Prioritizer accommodates the evolving importance of tasks in complex dependency graphs. Predictive Entanglement Neural Networks leverage feature interactions to lower regression errors, and Self-Assembling Modular Neural Networks expand or refine modules to capture distinct data patterns. Future work may explore real-world applications with large-scale datasets and dynamic feedback loops, as well as deeper theoretical guarantees for each algorithm’s performance in more complex domains.
